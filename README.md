This was my senior seminar project to fulfill the requirements for my bachelor
of mathematics. The accompanying paper can be found
[here](https://www.example.com/), while a demonstration of the
too can be found [here](https://github.com/JacobRThompson/MeanCurvatureShader/raw/master/Recordings/Animation.mp4).
